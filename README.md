Handling Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) in Lua

The uuid module is used to generate and parse uuids. It uses the libuuid by
Theodore Y. Ts'o. libuuid is part of the util-linux package since version
2.15.1 and is available from ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/.
This documentation is therefore based on the libuuid documentation.
